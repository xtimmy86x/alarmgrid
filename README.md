Industrial Alarm Panel is a Home Assistant custom integration that provides a DCS-style alarm annunciator for industrial, energy, and equipment monitoring.

It creates Home Assistant entities, exposes services and a websocket API, persists alarm rules and runtime state, stores alarm history in SQLite, and serves a dedicated sidebar panel at `/industrial-alarms`.

![Industrial Alarm Panel preview](docs/images/industrial-alarm-panel-preview.png)

## Highlights

- Dedicated Home Assistant sidebar panel at `/industrial-alarms`
- DCS-style alarm lifecycle: active, acknowledged, cleared, shelved, disabled
- Priority levels with horn behavior: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`, `status`
- Per-rule binary sensors and operator action buttons
- Rule storage, runtime state persistence, and SQLite alarm history
- Browser horn and optional media-player sound output
- Suggested alarm rule generator for PowerTag/electrical/solar-water sensors
- Event-driven panel refresh with a polling fallback
- HACS-ready repository layout with local Home Assistant brand images

## What's New in v1.0.13

- Fixed alarm timing fields so `delay_on_seconds`, `delay_off_seconds`, and `min_active_duration_seconds` now drive the alarm state machine instead of only being stored.
- Added Home Assistant timer scheduling so delayed alarm activations and clears complete even when the source entity does not change again.
- Persisted pending timing state so debounce windows survive Home Assistant storage round-trips.
- Clarified how to use `delay_on_seconds: 5` for alarms that should activate only after the condition lasts longer than 5 seconds.

## What's New in v1.0.12

- Added panel presets for shelving alarms for 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days.
- Added a **Shelved Until** alarm table column so operators can see the current `shelve_expiry`.
- Kept the Home Assistant `shelve_alarm` service duration-based with `duration_minutes`; use `1440` for 1 day, `4320` for 3 days, or `10080` for 7 days.
- Bumped the frontend cache-busting version and package metadata for the new release.

## What's New in v1.0.11

- Added **Select All** and **Deselect All** controls to Suggested Rules previews.
- Added a mobile panel menu button so operators can open the Home Assistant sidebar when edge-swipe is blocked by the panel.
- Preserved horizontal table scroll during alarm, history, rules, and suggested-rule refreshes so wide tables stay on the inspected columns.
- Bumped the frontend cache-busting version and package metadata for the new release.

## What's New in v1.0.9

- Added resizable columns to the alarm, history, rules, and suggested-rule listings.
- Added a 2-second delay before new unacknowledged alarms receive full DCS row coloring, reducing transient visual noise.
- Throttled browser and media-player horn output so repeated Home Assistant refreshes or alarm floods do not stack noisy tones.
- Bumped the frontend cache-busting version and package metadata for the new release.

## What's New in v1.0.8

- Added **Suggested Rules** in the panel Rules tab.
- Suggested rules can create high-consumption, low-voltage, high-voltage, high solar-water temperature, and unavailable-sensor alarms.
- Added full-row DCS-style alarm colors, with acknowledged alarms shown in neutral gray.
- Added event-driven alarm refresh so new alarms appear faster than the polling fallback.
- Fixed Rules tab form inputs being cleared by automatic refresh while an operator is typing.
- Bumped the frontend cache-busting version to force Home Assistant browsers to load the new panel bundle.

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=AlRiachi&repository=industrial-alarm-panel&category=integration)

### HACS

1. Add this repository as a HACS custom repository with category `Integration`:

   ```text
   https://github.com/AlRiachi/industrial-alarm-panel
   ```

2. Install **Industrial Alarm Panel** from HACS.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration** and search for **Industrial Alarm Panel**.

After upgrading through HACS, restart Home Assistant again. If the sidebar panel was already open, hard refresh the browser with `Ctrl+Shift+R`.

The repository follows HACS integration layout rules: all runtime files are under `custom_components/industrial_alarm_panel`, with a root `hacs.json`, GitHub releases, and one integration directory under `custom_components`.

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for manual installation, media-player sound setup, and a test rule.

## Brand Assets

This repository includes local Home Assistant brand assets in `custom_components/industrial_alarm_panel/brand/`:

- `icon.png` and `dark_icon.png`
- `logo.png` and `dark_logo.png`

Home Assistant 2026.3 and newer can serve local brand assets for custom integrations. Older Home Assistant versions still run the integration, but may not show the local icon/logo in all UI surfaces.

## Lovelace Card

You can embed the same Industrial Alarm Panel frontend in a Lovelace dashboard as a custom card. In normal Home Assistant storage-mode dashboards, the integration automatically registers this JavaScript module resource and keeps it versioned:

```yaml
url: /industrial_alarm_panel/frontend/dist/industrial-alarm-panel.js?v=1.0.13
type: module
```

If you use Lovelace YAML mode, add the resource above to `ui-lovelace.yaml` manually. Then add the card to a dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:industrial-alarm-panel-card
title: Industrial Alarms
tab: active
hide_tabs: false
```

Card options:

- `title`: card heading shown above metrics and actions.
- `tab`: initial view (`active`, `unacknowledged`, `history`, `shelved`, `disabled`, `rules`, or `settings`).
- `hide_tabs`: set to `true` to lock the card to the selected tab.
- `hide_header`: set to `true` to hide the title, metrics, and action buttons.
- `min_height`: optional CSS height such as `420px`; defaults to dashboard card sizing instead of the full sidebar height.

The integration registers the static frontend path even when the sidebar panel option is disabled, and it persists the Lovelace resource in storage-mode dashboards so the card is still loaded after a browser refresh.


## Entities

Global entities include:

- `sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_active_count`
- `sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_unacknowledged_count`
- `sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_critical_count`
- `sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_high_count`
- `sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_last_alarm`
- `sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_last_event`
- `binary_sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_any_active`
- `binary_sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_any_unacknowledged`
- `binary_sensor.industrial_alarm_panel_horn_active`
- `switch.industrial_alarm_panel_sound_enabled`
- `button.industrial_alarm_panel_acknowledge_all`
- `button.industrial_alarm_panel_silence_horn`
- `button.industrial_alarm_panel_unsilence_horn`
- `button.industrial_alarm_panel_test_sound`
- `select.industrial_alarm_panel_filter_priority`
- `number.industrial_alarm_panel_history_retention_days`

Every stored rule also gets a binary alarm sensor and action buttons after the integration reloads.

## Rule Creation

Create and manage rules from **Developer Tools > Services**, automations, scripts, or the panel's rule editor.

Rules use stable Home Assistant `entity_id` values. For numeric range alarms, create two rules: one `below` rule and one `above` rule.

### Suggested Rules

Open **Industrial Alarms > Rules > Suggested Rules** and click **Preview Suggested Rules** to scan current Home Assistant `sensor.*` entities before creating anything. Select the suggestions you want, then click **Create Selected**. **Create All** is still available after preview, but it asks for confirmation and shows the estimated Home Assistant entity count.

Default suggested thresholds:

- `High W`: `2000 W` for power/high-consumption sensors
- `Low V`: `207 V`
- `High V`: `253 V`
- `Solar C`: `75 C` for solar water/tank/boiler temperature sensors

The generator detects candidates from `device_class`, unit of measurement, entity ID, and friendly name. It skips generated rule IDs that already exist so repeated previews or creates do not duplicate rules. Generated suggested rules use IDs beginning with `auto_`.

If too many suggested rules were created, use **Remove Auto-Generated Rules** in the same section. It removes stored `auto_` rules and the per-rule alarm/button entities created by this integration, but it does not remove the original source sensors. For manual cleanup, select rows in the Rules table and click **Delete Selected**.

### Rule Fields

Common fields:

- `id`: stable rule ID. Keep it lowercase and unique.
- `entity_id`: source entity to monitor.
- `name`: operator-facing alarm name.
- `tag`: short DCS-style tag.
- `area`: room, plant area, or system area.
- `system`: equipment group, such as `SOFAR Inverter`, `Grid`, or `Electric Heater`.
- `condition`: one of `above`, `below`, `equal`, `not_equal`, `contains`, `is_on`, `is_off`, `state_changed`, `unavailable`, `unavailable_for`, `unknown_for`, `manual`.
- `threshold`: numeric value for `above` and `below`, or expected text for text conditions.
- `deadband`: hysteresis for numeric alarms.
- `priority`: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`, or `status`.
- `instructions`: short operator guidance shown in the panel.

Optional fields include `requires_ack`, `audible`, `delay_on_seconds`, `delay_off_seconds`, `min_active_duration_seconds`, `repeat_alarm_after_seconds`, `show_when_cleared`, and `shelving_allowed`.

Timing fields are in seconds:

- `delay_on_seconds`: the source condition must remain true for this long before the alarm activates. Use `5` for "alarm only if this condition lasts longer than 5 seconds".
- `delay_off_seconds`: the source condition must remain clear for this long before an active alarm clears.
- `min_active_duration_seconds`: once activated, keep the alarm active for at least this long even if the source clears sooner.

### High Temperature Rule

Create a rule from Developer Tools > Services:

```yaml
service: industrial_alarm_panel.create_rule
data:
  rule:
    id: inverter_high_temp
    entity_id: sensor.inverter_temperature
    name: Inverter High Temperature
    tag: INV-TEMP-HH
    area: Solar Inverter
    system: PV
    condition: above
    threshold: 75
    deadband: 2
    priority: critical
    requires_ack: true
    audible: true
    delay_on_seconds: 5
    delay_off_seconds: 10
    instructions: Check inverter ventilation, fans, ambient temperature, and loading.
```

### Voltage Range Rules

```yaml
service: industrial_alarm_panel.create_rule
data:
  rule:
    id: grid_phase_a_voltage_low
    entity_id: sensor.shellyem3_e8db84d68e3c_channel_a_voltage
    name: Grid Phase A Voltage Low
    tag: GRID-A-V-LOW
    area: Electrical
    system: Grid Meter
    condition: below
    threshold: 207
    deadband: 3
    priority: high
    instructions: Check Phase A supply voltage and upstream breaker or utility condition.
```

```yaml
service: industrial_alarm_panel.create_rule
data:
  rule:
    id: grid_phase_a_voltage_high
    entity_id: sensor.shellyem3_e8db84d68e3c_channel_a_voltage
    name: Grid Phase A Voltage High
    tag: GRID-A-V-HIGH
    area: Electrical
    system: Grid Meter
    condition: above
    threshold: 253
    deadband: 3
    priority: high
    instructions: Check Phase A supply voltage and utility condition.
```

### Binary Problem Rule

```yaml
service: industrial_alarm_panel.create_rule
data:
  rule:
    id: electric_heater_overheating
    entity_id: binary_sensor.shellyplus1pm_c4d8d55505a0_switch_0_overheating
    name: Electric Heater Overheating
    tag: EHEATER-OVERTEMP
    area: Electrical
    system: Electric Heater
    condition: is_on
    priority: critical
    instructions: Turn off heater circuit if safe and inspect the load before re-enabling.
```

### Starter Alarm Ideas

Good first rules usually monitor:

- inverter native fault words, for example SOFAR fault registers `> 0`
- grid voltage low/high, for example `< 207 V` and `> 253 V` on 230 V nominal systems
- grid frequency low/high, for example `< 49.5 Hz` and `> 50.5 Hz`
- inverter heatsink or cabinet temperature high
- PV insulation resistance low
- solar heater water temperature high
- built-in problem binary sensors such as overheating, overcurrent, overpower, or overvoltage
- Home Assistant host power problem sensors
- internet connectivity loss if cloud/mobile notification delivery matters

## Services

The integration registers:

- `industrial_alarm_panel.acknowledge_alarm`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.acknowledge_all`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.silence_horn`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.unsilence_horn`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.shelve_alarm`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.unshelve_alarm`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.disable_alarm`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.enable_alarm`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.create_rule`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.update_rule`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.delete_rule`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.test_sound`
- `industrial_alarm_panel.export_history`

Silence only stops horn output. Acknowledgement changes the alarm lifecycle state.
Shelving is temporary. In the panel, choose a **Shelve for** preset before clicking a row's **Shelve** button. In service calls, set `duration_minutes`; day-based shelves use minute values such as `1440` for 1 day and `10080` for 7 days.

## Sound

Browser sound is generated in the panel with Web Audio after the operator clicks **Enable Alarm Sound**. Media-player output uses Home Assistant `media_player.play_media` with files expected at:

```text
/config/www/industrial_alarm_panel/sounds/
```

Default filenames are `critical.mp3`, `high.mp3`, `medium.mp3`, `low.mp3`, and `info.mp3`.

## Storage

Rules are stored in Home Assistant storage with key `industrial_alarm_panel.rules`.
Runtime alarm states are stored with key `industrial_alarm_panel.state`.
History is stored in `/config/industrial_alarm_panel_history.db`.

## Troubleshooting

- If `/industrial-alarms` is blank after an update, restart Home Assistant and hard refresh the browser with `Ctrl+Shift+R`.
- If a newly created rule does not show as an entity yet, wait for the integration reload to finish or restart Home Assistant.
- If the horn does not play in the browser, click **Enable Alarm Sound** in the panel. Browsers block audio until a user gesture.
- If media-player sound does not play, confirm your MP3 files exist under `/config/www/industrial_alarm_panel/sounds/`.
- Check **Settings > System > Logs** for `industrial_alarm_panel` errors.
